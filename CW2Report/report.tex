\section{Introduction and Background}
Parallelise 3 prime number generators that store prime numbers up to 1 billion in a file and analyse the time they take

\paragraph{Parallel Technique 1}
What techniques did you use 

\paragraph{Parallel Technique 2}
You get the point 

\section{Initial Analysis}
Initial analysis of the base-line performance of the application and likely places that can be parallelised.
\section{Methodology}
Methodology used
Description and justification of the approach used and its overall suitability and rigour.
\section{Results and Discussion}
Results presented
Suitable performance analysis and testing documentation for the problem, including quality of presentation of the results.
\section{Conclusion}
Conclusions drawn
Level of discussion and appropriateness of the conclusions drawn based on the results gathered.
